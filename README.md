# 2048 in Godot 4

This repository is a fully working 3D clone of the popular mobile game 2048.

It was developed using only Godot 4 and GDScript. I wanted to open-source this as an example people can use to develop similar games.

## TODO:

- Lose conditions (please note: the game works but doesn't actually check whether you no longer have valid moves)
- Score keeping
- Saving previous best/high score
- Polish (particles, sounds, etc).
